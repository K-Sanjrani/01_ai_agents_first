OpenRouter is a platform that provides a unified way to access a wide range of large language models (LLMs) from multiple providers, including both commercial options like OpenAI and Anthropic, and open-source models like Mistral and LLaMA. It simplifies using these models by offering a single API endpoint, allowing developers to switch between models without changing their code. The platform also optimizes for cost, performance, and availability by routing requests to the best provider based on factors like price, latency, and uptime.
